# Product Vision

## Target Customer
Developers and product teams who want to learn how AI can improve BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) workflows. This includes:
- Developers looking for practical examples of AI-assisted testing
- Product managers and analysts interested in AI-assisted requirements writing
- Teams evaluating how to integrate AI into their development process

## Customer Problem
BDD is powerful but underutilized because:
- Writing good Gherkin scenarios requires skill and practice
- Connecting requirements to tests feels like extra overhead
- Teams don't know where AI fits into the BDD workflow
- Examples online are either too simple or too complex to learn from

## Value Proposition
A working JavaScript application that demonstrates AI-assisted BDD from requirements to tests, using a realistic admission domain that's complex enough to be meaningful but simple enough to understand.

## Key Benefits
- See AI-assisted Gherkin scenario generation in action
- Learn how to structure a BDD project with modern tooling
- Understand the connection between requirements, scenarios, and tests
- Get a template you can adapt for your own projects

## Product Principles
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Simple, readable code that teaches
- **Realistic domain**: Admission scenarios that mirror real business logic
- **End-to-end examples**: From requirement to passing test
- **AI as assistant**: AI helps write requirements and tests, humans review and refine

## Success Looks Like
Someone can clone this repo, understand how AI-assisted BDD works, and apply the patterns to their own project within a few hours.
