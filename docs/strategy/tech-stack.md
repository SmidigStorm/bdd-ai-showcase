# Tech Stack

## Languages

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Primary language for both frontend and backend
- **Gherkin** - BDD scenario language for feature files

## Frameworks

- **Express.js** - Backend API server (minimal, widely understood)
- **Vanilla JS + HTML** - Frontend (no framework, maximum simplicity for learning)

## Testing

- **Playwright** - Browser automation and E2E testing
- **Playwright-BDD** - Gherkin/Cucumber integration for Playwright

## Data

- **In-memory storage** - No database, simplest possible for demo purposes
  - Data resets on server restart
  - Keeps focus on BDD patterns, not persistence

## Infrastructure

- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **npm** - Package management

## Key Libraries

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| playwright | Browser automation |
| playwright-bdd | Gherkin scenario runner |
| express | HTTP server |

## Notes

This stack prioritizes **simplicity and learning** over production readiness. The goal is to demonstrate AI-assisted BDD, not to build a scalable admission system.
